## üìùDescription
Our project is a comprehensive tool designed to benefit a wide range of users, including students, analysts, and anyone seeking efficient information retrieval. We have developed a YouTube video summarizer coupled with an important slides generator, packaged in the form of PDFs.

1.This feature enables users to extract key points and summaries from YouTube videos. It condenses lengthy videos into concise and easily digestible summaries.

2.Our tool automatically identifies significant slides within a presentation or lecture video. It extracts these slides and compiles them into a PDF document for easy reference.

3.Our integrated chatbot allows users to interact with the video content through questions and answers.Users can ask questions related to the video and receive responses based on the content discussed.

4.We've crafted our website with the MERN stack‚ÄîMongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js‚Äîto seamlessly blend front-end and back-end elements. Our user interface, styled with Tailwind CSS, offers a sleek and contemporary appearance, enhancing user interaction.

## üìàProgress

List down all the fully implemented features in your project

- [x] Summarization of YouTube videos (Summarizer)
Our tool can extract key points and summaries from YouTube videos. It condenses lengthy videos into concise and easily digestible summaries.
It is divided into 3 parts:
1. #### Video Download
    The user can input the URL of the video they want to summarize. The tool will then download the video from YouTube.
2. #### Text Extraction
    The tool will then extract the text from the video.
3. #### Summarization
    The tool will then summarize the text and display the summary to the user.

   - [x] Important Slides Generation (Slides Extractor)
Our tool automatically identifies significant slides within a presentation or lecture video. It extracts these slides and compiles them into a PDF document for easy reference.
It is divided into 3 parts:
1. #### Video Download
    The user can input the URL of the video they want to summarize. The tool will then download the video from YouTube.
2. #### Slide Extraction
    The tool will then extract the slides from the video.
3. #### Slide Classification
    The tool will then classify the slides and display the PDF to the user.
    ##### Basis of Classification
    - Slide with text
    - Slide with image
    - Slide with both text and image
    - Nth slide is not similar to the previous slide (N-1)th slide.

- [x] Chatbot Integration
Our integrated chatbot allows users to interact with the video content through questions and answers. Users can ask questions related to the video and receive responses based on the content discussed.

## üîÆFuture Scope

- In our project, we aspire to expand functionality by not only allowing users to input playlist URLs but also providing comprehensive summaries and detailed notes for each playlist. This enhancement aims to offer users a deeper understanding of the content within the playlists, facilitating quicker navigation and comprehension 
- In addition to our current objectives, we are looking to implement a feature that generates graphs for each topic within a playlist. These graphs will visually represent the relationships, connections, and frequencies of topics present in the playlist content. By visualizing the structure of topics, users will gain a clearer understanding of the playlist's thematic landscape, allowing for easier navigation and comprehension.
